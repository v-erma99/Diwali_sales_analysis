# Diwali_sales_analysis
The "Diwali Sales Analysis" project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization project that leverages popular libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize sales data during the Diwali festival season.



During this project I find Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP,
Maharashtra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more
likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
